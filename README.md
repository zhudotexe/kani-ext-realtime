## Publishing to PyPI

To publish your package to PyPI, this repo comes with a GitHub Action that will automatically build and upload new
releases. Alternatively, you can build and publish the package manually.

### GitHub Action

To use the GitHub Action, you must configure it as a publisher for your project on
PyPI: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/

The workflow is configured with the following settings:

- workflow name: `pythonpublish.yml`
- environment name: `pypi`

Once you've configured this, each release you publish on GitHub will automatically be built and uploaded to PyPI.
You can also manually trigger the workflow.

Make sure to update the version number in `pyproject.toml` before releasing a new version!
